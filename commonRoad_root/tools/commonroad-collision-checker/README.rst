CommonRoad-Collision-Checker
============================

System Requirements
-------------------

The software is written in Python 3.6 and tested on MacOs and Linux. The usage of the Anaconda_ Python distribution is strongly recommended. The requirements for the C++ collision checker library are a C++11 compiler and CMake. The requirements for the Python wrapper are C++11 compiler, CMake, and Python 3.6 with development headers. If you are a Mac user, we recommend you to use Homebrew_, allowing you to install required dependencies such as Eigen.

            $ make
            $ sudo make install

#. Install `FCL -- The Flexible Collision Library <https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl>`_:

   Clone the repository from `https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl <https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl>`_ (master branch) and execute the following commands.

	.. code-block:: bash

Installation
============

Full Installation with Anaconda
-------------------------------

It is assumed that you have installed Anaconda_ and that your Anaconda environment is called **commonroad-py37**.
(Commonroad-search is written in python3.7)

#. Open your console in the root folder of the CommonRoad-Collision-Checker.

#. Activate your environment with

	.. code-block:: bash

		    $ conda activate commonroad-py37

#. Compile the CommonRoad-Collision-Checker library by running

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ cmake -DADD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=TRUE -DPATH_TO_PYTHON_ENVIRONMENT="/path/to/your/anaconda3/envs/commonroad-py37" -DPYTHON_VERSION="3.7" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

        The next line refers only to users of Mac OS X 10+:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ sed -i '' 's!-lccd!/usr/local/lib/libccd.2.0.dylib!' python_binding/CMakeFiles/pycrcc.dir/link.txt

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ make

        **Note that you have to replace**
         - *"/path/to/your/anaconda3/envs/commonroad-py37"* with the path to your Anaconda environment;
         - *"3.7"*  with the Python version of your Anaconda environment.


#. (Optional) Install the CommonRoad-Collision-Checker with

    .. code-block:: bash

            $ cd ..
            $ python setup.py install

    **OR** add the root folder of the CommonRoad-Collision-Checker to your Python-Interpreter.
